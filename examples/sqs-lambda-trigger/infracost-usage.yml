# resource_type_default_usage:
  ##
  ## The following usage values apply to each resource of the given type, which is useful when you want to define defaults.
  ## All values are commented-out, you can uncomment resource types and customize as needed.
  ##
  # aws_lambda_function:
    # monthly_requests: 0 # Monthly requests to the Lambda function.
    # request_duration_ms: 0 # Average duration of each request in milliseconds.
  # aws_sqs_queue:
    # monthly_requests: 0.0 # Monthly requests to SQS.
    # request_size_kb: 0 # Size of requests to SQS, billed in 64KB chunks. So 1M requests at 128KB uses 2M requests.
# resource_usage:
  ##
  ## The following usage values apply to individual resources and override any value defined in the resource_type_default_usage section.
  ## All values are commented-out, you can uncomment resources and customize as needed.
