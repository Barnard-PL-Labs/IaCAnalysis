  aws_lambda_function.example_lambda:
    monthly_requests: 10 # Monthly requests to the Lambda function.
    request_duration_ms: 0 # Average duration of each request in milliseconds.
  aws_lambda_function.example_lambda2:
    monthly_requests: 10 # Monthly requests to the Lambda function.
    request_duration_ms: 0 # Average duration of each request in milliseconds.
  aws_sqs_queue.some_queue:
    monthly_requests: 10 # Monthly requests to SQS.
    request_size_kb: 0 # Size of requests to SQS, billed in 64KB chunks. So 1M requests at 128KB uses 2M requests.
